# FP-Whatever-Marketplace
## Description
Our motivation for this project was to develop and create a new upbeat environment for people to buy and sell goods/services. We built this project because we needed a new website to buy/sell different goods and services. This application solves the problem of having to rely on other sites like Ebay and Facebook Marketplace and the issues that those sites bring. It also brings competition to an otherwise stagnant industry. From this project we learned a lot collectively. Some of the main things that we learned were how to make a client and server work together in separate repositories, how the MERN stack communicates with all of its different components, how to use GraphQL to make queries, how to typeDefs and resolvers work and function together,how to work together as a team and how to learn from one another.
